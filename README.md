message-thrift
==============

A python bidirectional communicate server framework built on thrift. 

Thrift is a good across-language RPC framework, but can only be used in RPC communication. Message-thrift is a package sending/receiving framework built on thrift. Both the client side and the server side can send a package initiatively over a single TCP transport.

At present, message-thrift only has python server-side code.
